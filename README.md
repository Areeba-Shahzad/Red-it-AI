## üí° AI Engine

Red-it's core intelligence relies on its **AI Engine**, which uses **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API (a Large Language Model)**. This AI powers key features:

* **Intelligent Summarization:** It processes web content to provide concise, key-point summaries.
* **Dynamic Flashcard Generation:** The AI analyzes text to create flashcards with questions and answers.
* **Structured Presentation Content:** It transforms summaries into organized outlines suitable for slides.

These functions are based on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with the `interactionwithGPT.py` module managing communication with the OpenAI API for seamless integration.
